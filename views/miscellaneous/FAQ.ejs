	<h4> What is the right age for my child to use Finnest?</h4>
		<p >The minimum age to use the Finnest card and app is 8 years old. If you feel that your child is competent enough to recognizes basic math concepts like addition and subtraction, then they're ready for Finnest! Additionally, we recommend parents and children to have access to a mobile screen, so that we can provide the full experience of Finnest. Overall, we see highest success rates when young learners begin around 10 years old. </p>
